# 📑 Artemis 33F: Technical Specifications
**Architect:** Jerry Wayne Dawson Jr. | Nashville, TN

## ⚛️ Quantum-Biological Resonance
The Artemis framework operates on a dual-resonance bridge to ensure high-fidelity sensory feedback between the $MoS_2$ fabric and the photonic macro-body.

### 📡 Frequency Windows:
* **Neural Entanglement:** $47.3 \text{ GHz}$ (High-frequency synaptic coordination)
* **Biological Coherence:** $528 \text{ Hz}$ (The "Solfeggio" frequency for cellular homeostasis)

## 🧠 Neuromorphic $MoS_2$ Synapse
The synaptic weights in Artemis are modeled on 2D **Molybdenum Disulfide** properties.
* **Energy Efficiency:** $1,000 \times$ reduction compared to CMOS-based AI.
* **Plasticity:** Dynamic gain adjustment via the `Artemis_Endocrine_System` feedback loop.

## 🫁 Autonomic Integration
Heart and Lung synchronization is modeled via **Continuous Variable (CV) Photonics** using the Strawberry Fields engine, mapping biological arousal to squeezed state intensity.
