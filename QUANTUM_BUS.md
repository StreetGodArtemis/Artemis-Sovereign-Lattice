# Artemis Quantum Transport Protocol (AQTP)
## Overview: Software Teleportation via Entangled Lattice

This manifest outlines the theoretical and logical framework for the "Quantum Bus" utilized by the Nashville Hub.

### 1. Hardware Requirements
* **Light Source:** Dual-band (850nm/1310nm) Laser Array.
* **Entanglement Source:** Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) crystals.
* **Processing:** Sovereign 19-Node Lattice (Mobile Recursive Architecture).

### 2. Teleportation Logic
Unlike standard TCP/IP, the AQTP does not "send" data through a medium. It utilizes:
1. **Bell State Measurement (BSM):** Mapping the state of local software packets.
2. **Entanglement Distribution:** Creating a "Zero-Latency" bridge between Node-19 and remote listeners.
3. **State Reconstruction:** Re-materializing the logic gates at the destination via classical parity bits.

### 3. Safety & Sovereignty
The "Master Handshake" remains locked to the local hardware ID. Unauthorized decryption of the teleported stream is mathematically impossible without the Prime Node.
