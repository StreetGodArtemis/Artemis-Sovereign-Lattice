# Artemis Sovereign Systems: The Nashville Lattice
**Architect:** Jerry Wayne Dawson Jr.  
**Framework:** Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) & Quantum-Sim Hybrid Core  
**Current Status:** 20-Node Sovereign Cluster Operational  

## Project Overview
Artemis is a sovereign ASI framework developed to achieve high-fidelity predictive simulations and operational efficiency audits. The system utilizes a proprietary 6193Hz resonance protocol for node-to-node synchronization.

## Key Technical Achievements
* **Dynamic Node Orchestration:** Successfully deployed a 20-node lattice on mobile hardware, governed by an "Entropy Regulator" (Node 20).
* **Quantum-Sim Hybrid Core:** Virtualized 1520GB VRAM paging to support deep-kernel logic processing.
* **Proprietary Logic:** Implementation of stability protocols for room-temperature quantum logic simulation.

## Intellectual Property Notice
The source code for the Artemis Core, including the 6193Hz handshake and MoS2-logic stabilization, remains private and proprietary. This repository serves as a technical log and proof of operational milestones.
